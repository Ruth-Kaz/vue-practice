# Vue.js Practice Task

This project is aimed at practicing various Vue.js features including:

- [Content directives](02-content-directives)
- [Attribute binding](03-attribute-binding)
- [Class binding](04-class-bindings)
- [Conditional rendering](05-conditional-rendering)
- [List rendering](06-list-rendering)
- [Computed properties and methods](07-computed-and-methods)
- [Event handling](08-event-handling)

## Features Covered

### Content Directives

Content directives allow you to manipulate the DOM based on Vue.js data. Common directives include `v-if`, `v-show`, `v-for`, and `v-bind`.

### Attribute Binding

Attribute binding allows you to dynamically bind HTML attributes to Vue.js data. This can be achieved using the `v-bind` directive or shorthand `:`.

### Class Binding

Class binding allows you to dynamically add or remove CSS classes based on Vue.js data. This is typically done using the `v-bind:class` directive or shorthand `:class`.

### Conditional Rendering

Conditional rendering allows you to conditionally render elements based on Vue.js data. This can be done using directives like `v-if` and `v-show`.

### List Rendering

List rendering allows you to render lists of data dynamically using the `v-for` directive. This is useful for rendering arrays of data or iterating over object properties.

### Computed Properties and Methods

Computed properties and methods are both ways to manipulate data in Vue.js. Computed properties are cached based on their reactive dependencies, while methods are called whenever the component re-renders.

### Event Handling

Event handling in Vue.js allows you to listen to DOM events and execute Vue.js methods in response. This can be achieved using the `v-on` directive or shorthand `@`.
